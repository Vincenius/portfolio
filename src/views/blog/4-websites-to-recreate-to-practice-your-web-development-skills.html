                    <p>The best way to learn web development is by practice. But when you get started you might feel lost. There are just so many things to learn, which makes it hard to choose the right project to get started.</p>
                    <p>In the following I'll share some sites you can recreate to practice some of the basic concepts. I'd recommend to start from scratch and to avoid CSS frameworks in the beginning. Also try copy it without looking at the source code of the website.</p>
